## About Project
Game was a final project of Coder’s Lab Boot Camp. Main goal was to recreate turn based Pokémon battles and complex damage calculations that take place during them. Entire game was built in React framework with support of Redux and Sass. Since it was my first project, the code isn’t of the highest quality, but definitely represents logical and conceptual thinking that was required to plan an entire game on my own.

## Instalation
- clone repository and open 
- npm install 
- npm start or npm run dev 

## In Future 
The game requires some work and propably will receive rework in near future. 
The aspects that I want to better or expand:
  - add attack animations 
  - rewrite html 
  - rewrite css into proper Sass
  - calibrate attack caluclation for higher damage per hit 
  - add RWD 
  - allow to control game from buttons placed on gameboy mock-up 
  - add new pokemon
  - add pokemon segregation by levels and stage of evolution 
  - add "create your own team" feature
